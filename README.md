## 📋 Assignment Overview

The assignment was split into four tasks focusing on building an interactive mobile-friendly interface and implementing JavaScript logic for data handling:

---

### ✅ Task 1: HTML & CSS UI with Interactivity

- Designed a clean web page using **HTML** and **CSS**
- Implemented two input buttons for name and course entry
- Buttons trigger pop-up messages with friendly prompts
- Dynamic display of welcome messages and student details
- Styled interface with custom colours and text formatting

---

### ✅ Task 2: JavaScript Object Creation & Filtering

- Created a constructor function for a **Course Module**
- Instantiated 5 module objects with:
  - Name, Code, StartDate, EndDate, CourseName, and Students
- Used `Array.filter()` with arrow functions to filter based on `courseName`

---

### ✅ Task 3: JSON Representation

- Converted the module objects into **JSON format**
- Demonstrated the output using Node.js via terminal
- Ensured correct syntax and object structure for JSON compatibility

---

### ✅ Task 4: Array Map with Arrow Functions

- Applied `Array.map()` to convert course names to **UPPERCASE**
- Displayed results in the terminal for validation
- Emphasised usage of functional programming in JavaScript
